# Project Title: Enhancing and modifying low quality face images for creating good quality 3D avatars

Aims to create an end-to-end framework to prepare a face image for avatar generation, which involves blind face restoration, face frontalization and facial expression manipulation.

# Usage
1. `sh setup.sh`
2. `sh main.sh`, passing the path to images as a parameter, e.g. `sh main.sh input`

Results will be saved in Modifying-face-images/output.

If cannot be ran locally, could submit `run.sh` to the DoC GPU cluster.
